# Python - Training
In this project I will go through Python exercises that I completed for my own development in data analysis and to build on my technical proficiency. These projects covered:
  - Python foundational skills including if statements, shortcut operators, data types
  - Indexing data into a list, tuple, set, dictionary
  - Navigating datasets with while and for loops
  - Using Pandas to upload and mount dataframes, inspecting and cleaning data
  - Creating data visualisations using Matplotlib and Seaborn
